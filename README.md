# C++ Algorithm


### Sort

1. STL Sort 
- Time Complexity (n log n ~ n^2)
- Easy to use
- Commonly used

2. Merge Sort 
- Time Complexity (n log n)
- Fast
- Not common

3. Selection Sort 
- Time Complexity (n^2)
- Slow
- Never use it

4. Heap Sort 
- Time Complexity (n log n)
- Fast
- Not common

5. Insertion Sort
- Time Complexity (n^2)
- Slow
- Never use it


### Graph Navigation

1. DFS
